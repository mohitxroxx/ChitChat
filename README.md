<b>Welcome to this repository for the final task for BDCOE, I've made a chatting application with real time responses on either side, it is based on the socket.io library.</b>
<br><br>
The webapp consists of login/signup and chatting page with each user with unique usernames and data being stored in mongoDb.
Upon registering the user gets the welocome mail and is good to chat with others.
<br><br>
To start the webapp simply click on this link -> https://chit-chat-mocha.vercel.app/
<br><br>
To debug/run it on your system, clone the repository and follow these steps to run the webapp
step 1- open terminal and type yarn in the directory
step 2- after the packages are installed type yarn start to start that directory in dev mode.
<br><br>
I've primarily learned and implement the backend using Nodejs,Express and MongoDB.
For the frontend part I watched few tutorials and worked my way through to implement the pages using React.
